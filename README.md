## üöÄ Projects

Here are some highlights of my work:

1. Poster for industrial talk

   - **Description: I participated in the AirAsia Industry Talk, a webinar hosted by the Faculty of Computing at UTM. The session provided valuable insights into AirAsia's evolution from a low-cost airline to a leader in the digital ecosystem. Key topics included their digital transformation journey, the early adoption of cloud technologies, and the implementation of a microservices architecture. Additionally, the talk shed light on career opportunities in software engineering and data science and strategies for adapting to remote work and fostering an inclusive workplace culture.
Collaborating on a poster summarizing these insights was a rewarding experience that sharpened my skills in teamwork, information synthesis, and design. This project enhanced my understanding of how ICT drives innovation and highlighted the importance of developing technical and interpersonal skills for future career success. Overall, the webinar and the poster project were both enlightening and inspiring, encouraging me further to explore the practical applications of technology in real-world scenarios.

2. visit to UTM digital

   - **Description: I attended a seminar hosted by UTM Digital, the digital arm of UTM Space, where we delved into its organizational structure and operational strategies. During the visit, we toured the open office space, which reflected a culture of collaboration and innovation, and visited UTM Digital Care, the department‚Äôs dedicated customer support unit. This visit offered valuable insights into how UTM Digital effectively manages its digital services and enhances customer engagement.

As part of the project, we created a video that summarized our experience and the key lessons learned, including the importance of streamlined workflows, teamwork, and a customer-focused mindset within a digital ecosystem. This experience underscored the value of well-structured operations and the need for adaptability in the ever-changing digital world.
